# quick-FOD
quick-FOD is a novel method to generate FODs for FLOSIC calculations.
-  k = 0.35, lambda = 1.33, and C = 0.25 is used for closed-shell molecules, radicals, andd transition state.
-  k = 0.60, lambda = 1.33, and C = 0.00 is used for Fe(H2O)6{3+} complex.
-  For other systems, quick-FOD offers possiblity of adjust the parameters.
